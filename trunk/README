Abstract:

A simple 3d image viewer in OpenGL using GLUT. A 3d image is a
sequence of 2d slices defining a volume. This application reads a
binary file and opens different OpenGL windows for each slice
direction (XY, XZ and YZ), and an additional window rendering the
volume using 3d texture. A CT scan of a skull (ct_skull.bin) is
provided as an example.

Instalation:

    Image 3D Viewer code was written and tested on Linux platform
    using OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) for interface functions.  To
    download and/or see more information about above dependency see:

    GLUT: http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut

    In order to proper compile the Image 3D Viewer code, the OpenGL
    and GLUT libraries should have been installed in your operating
    system.  The Makefile can be optionally edited to reflect specific
    configurations.

Usage:

    Image 3D Viewer program is designed to run using a graphics card
    with 3D texture support.  However, in the abscence of such card
    you can comment the DWIN4 variable in the Makefile to disable the
    fourth window which shows the volume as 3D texture.

    Image 3D Viewer program runs reading the volume using the first
    argument.  For example, run it by calling:

    $ ./image3dviewer ct_skull.bin

    will open the CT scan of a human skull opening the first window.

    Image 3D Viewer runtime commands are:

	  (s,?)	    --	show/hide slice/help information
	  (w)	    --	write current slice in pgm format
	  (p)	    --	keep proportion
	  (h/v)	    --	flip slice horizontal/vertical
    	  (up/down) --	next/previous slice
	  (pg up)   --	next 10 slice
	  (pg down) --	previous 10 slice
	  (1,2,3,4) --	open window: XY, YZ, XZ, 3D
	  (x/esc)   --	close current window
	  (q)	    --	quit application

File Formats:

    .bin	--	binary file containing 3d image (volume)
